Neymar junior is one of my favourite football player. He plays for Paris saint German. PSG are 2nd in their league table. Neymar has not won any ballon'dor yet.
Neymar came into prominence at Santos, where he made his professional debut aged 17. He helped the club win two successive Campeonato Paulista championships, 
a Copa do Brasil, and the 2011 Copa Libertadores; the latter being Santos' first since 1963.
